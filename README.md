# go-DDDNS
Go implementation of the Routing ID based Distributed Dynamic Domain Name Service

## Introduction

There is no such standard as DDDNS. I drafted this experiment myself to test if it is possible to create a clusters that "floats" on the floating IP assigned by the ISP or in environment that can only allow plug-and-play hosting.

If this project is proofed to be working and secure, this will be added to the ArozOS project as the fundamental section of its Clustering System.
